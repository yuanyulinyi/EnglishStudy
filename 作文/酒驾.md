![[edadc7f985c5e750ae27f523ebf996ac.png]]
The picture ==obviously and vividly== demonstrates a common social phenomenon of drunk driving. The driver in the picture has a bottle of wine in his right hand and ==the steering wheel== in the left, with no consideration of the woman walking in front of the car. ==There is no doubt that== drunk driving should be ==eradicated==. However, what can be done to ==put an end to== drunk driving?

Firstly, there should be systematic and strict laws to regulate and supervise all the drivers. Secondly, the whole society should actively inform the departments concerned of the cases of drunk driving. Wide-range supervision must be more efficient to warn those who favor drunk driving. 
Thirdly, the media should try every means to raise citizens  safety awareness and ==make the concept of “no drunk driving” deeply rooted in the minds of the public.== ==Only in this way can people consciously resist drunk driving.==

Safety is of great importance for all of us, and everybody has the responsibility to take the safety of himself as well as that of others into consideration.
